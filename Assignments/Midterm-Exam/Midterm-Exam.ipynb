    "**PART 1 INSTRUCTIONS:** Suppose you are a video game controller manufacturer interested in estimating the perceived comfort level of controller grips. To achieve this, you decide to conduct an experiment to assess different material types used for the controller grips (plastic, rubber, silicone, and metal). 10 prototypes of each grip type are manufactured and given to professional gamers (who all play the same game -- Counter-Strike) to test. The gamers use the controllers regularly for one month and then rate the comfort level on a scale from 1 - 10 with greater scores indicating a greater level of perceived comfort (one decimal allowed). The data from this experiment are stored in the Video Game Controllers.xlsx file. With these data, your tasks are:\n",

    "**Question 1.** Briefly define the objective of this experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.** Specify the outcome variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3.** Specify the independent variable. What are some possible lurking variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.** Briefly explain why a completely randomized design may be appropriate for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5.** State the null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6.** Perform appropriate exploratory analysis, including summary statistics **and** data visualizations. Do the results of these analyses support the null or alternative hypothesis more strongly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7.** Build a one-way ANOVA model. Test the assumption of normality using **both** a testing and visual method. Do the results of the normality test(s) support the assumption of normality? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 8.** Test the assumption of homogeneity of variance using **both** a testing and visual method. Do the results of the test(s) support the assumption of homogeneity of variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9.** Report the F-statistic and its associated p-value for the test for the treatment factor. Which of our two hypotheses is more strongly supported? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 10.** If the data more strongly support the alternative hypothesis, perform Tukey's HSD post-hoc test to determine which material types are significantly different from each other. If the data more strongly support the null hypothesis, explain why a post-hoc test would not be appropriate.\n",

    "**PART 2 INSTRUCTIONS:** The same video game controller manufacturing company is now trying to get into the business of creating virtual reality/artificial intelligence content for education. Specifically, they want to build a VR experience to simulate working with elderly patients at a healthcare facility to better prepare nursing students for potential careers in working with elderly patients. To test the VR's effectiveness, a group of 40 undergraduate nursing students were randomly and equally assigned to either a class session utilizing the VR or a class session using a traditional technique for teaching strategies for working with elderly patients. At the end of the class session, a 50 question quiz was given to both groups which measures attitudes toward elderly people. Scores range from 0-50 with greater scores indicating more favorable attitudes toward elderly people and vice versa. However, some students in the group have had prior working experience with elderly people which may have an effect on the quiz outcome. So in the experiment, we document which students have had prior working experience with elderly people and which haven't. The results of the experiment are contained in the `Nursing VR Study.xlsx` file. With these data, your tasks are:\n",
