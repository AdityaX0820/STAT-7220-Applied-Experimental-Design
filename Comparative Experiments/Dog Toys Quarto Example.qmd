Outcome = PSI when ball rips; IV = Formulation. Could be a lurking variable if different operators are used to test the balls.

## Question 3: Perform the Appropriate Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

## Read in Rubber Dog Ball Data ##

dogs <- read_excel("Comparative Experiments/Dog Toys.xlsx")

## Examine Data Structure ##

#install.packages('broom')
