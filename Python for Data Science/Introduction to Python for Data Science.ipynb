    "\n",
    "- Python is a useful tool and worthwhile to learn for several reasons:\n",
    "    1. It's free!\n",
    "    2. Because it's open source, thousands of people have contributed packages and functions at a pace that proprietary softwares can't compete with\n",
    "    3. It is a very flexible and robust general programming language, meaning there's a lot you can do with it in the data science space and beyond!\n",
    "    4. It has become basically the standard in industry\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python is command-line, object-oriented general programming language commonly used for data analysis, data science and statistics.\n",
