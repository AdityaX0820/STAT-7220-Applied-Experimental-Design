# STAT 7220: Applied Experimental Design

Welcome to STAT 7220! This course covers the design and analysis of experiments, with a focus on practical applications in various fields. Within this repository, you will find lecture notes, assignments, datasets, and additional resources to support your learning journey.

In this course, we will be using **Google Colab** for coding and analysis. Google Colab provides a convenient platform for running Python code in the cloud, allowing you to access your work from anywhere with an internet connection.

Below, you will find instructions on how to set up and work on your own copy of the course materials using Google Colab.
